# **Image Classification using CNN**

**Overview:**
This project aims to develop a model for image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories. The model leverages advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to accurately classify images.

**Features:**

- Image Classification: Classify images into predefined categories based on their content.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the image classification model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Project Breakdown:**

- Data Collection and Preparation: Utilize datasets from sources such as Kaggle to collect and preprocess image data for training and evaluation.
- Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
- Model Development: Develop CNN-based models using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train on the prepared image data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using various performance metrics and techniques such as cross-validation and confusion matrices.
- Fine-Tuning and Optimization: Fine-tune the models and optimize hyperparameters to improve performance and generalization.
- Deployment: Deploy the trained models for inference in real-world applications, potentially using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for building APIs.

**Technologies Used:**

Backend: Python for model development and training, TensorFlow or PyTorch for building CNN models, scikit-learn for evaluation metrics.
Frontend: Development of a user interface (UI) using Flask for handling HTTP requests. The API accepts image uploads and returns classification results and confidence levels. TensorFlow/Keras is utilized for loading and utilizing the CNN model, while Pillow (PIL) is used for image processing.
